# FINLEARN:

---

The financial analysis tool that continues to learn. Fin learn is a price prediction app that utilizes over 100 different sources and thousands of data points. Everything from the types of articles posted to weather, to general mental health.

I use social media apps to gauge the general mental health of society. The way I do that is gauge the kinds of posts that are posted each day. Then my algorithm uses a scale between 5 to -5. Once The social state is determined the algorithm checks big box retail stores to see how many reviews have been left and uses the review counts + their sentiment to check for correlation between volume of stocks and online shopping. The idea is that "buyers fever" floods over into the market and causes key stocks to go up.

Then from there there is a lot more intellectual property that I can't share publically but I can say there is over 100 technical indicators, 3000 links and AI as well as Deep Neural Networks at work determining stock movement.

Also, since most of the analysis is focused on minute data, my price predictor is making predictions an hour to 24 hours in advance and predicting just the next 3 days.
